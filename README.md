# VHDL flag of the town Libice nad Cidlinou

School project where I was supposed to design circuit in VHDL to draw flag of the town Libice nad Cidlinou and then make this flag animated by microinstruction position controller.

## The flag

See file `Libice_nad_Cidlinou.jpg`.

The flag is represented as X offset where blue stripe starts and ends. It is generated by `util/flagGenerator`. The generated code is inserted into `flag.vhd` file.

##Â The position controller

The position controller in file `positionController.vhd` is riden by instructions from `positionControllerROM.vhd` initialized from `positionController.hex`.

`positionController.hex` is compiled from `positionController.fl` by running:

	$ ./util/flc < positionController.fl > positionController.hex

Instructions are fixed-size (16 bits). First 8 bits is instruction code. However, currently microcontroller supports only 6 instructions. All instructions are described in `positionController.fl`.
